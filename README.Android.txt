 BUILDING FLTK SAMPLE WITH ANDROID STUDIO 3
============================================

There is no need to ever write a single line of Java.

Download and install AndroidStudio on your developer machine. If you use
AndroidStudio for the first time, use the IDE to download and build the
"Native Plasm" sample app. In the process, all resources required to build
FLTK will be installed. Once Native Plasm runs on your emulator or physical
device, you are ready to install FLTK.

Open the Android/HelloAndroid directory in AndroidStudio. The project should compile and run out of the box.
