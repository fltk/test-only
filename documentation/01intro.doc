/*! \page intro Introduction to FLTK

This manual describes FLTK version 2.0, a cross-platform C++ Graphical
User Interface (GUI) toolkit.  Each of the "related pages" in this
manual is designed as a tutorial for using FLTK, while the main
sections provide a complete reference for all FLTK widgets and
functions.

FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a LGPL'd C++ graphical user interface
toolkit for X (UNIX&reg;), OpenGL&reg;, Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;,
OS/X, and several other platforms. It was originally developed by
Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a small group of
developers across the world with a central repository in the US.

\section licensing Licensing

FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is &copy;1998-2007
by Bill Spitzak and others.  Use and distribution of FLTK is governed
by the <A HREF=license.html>FLTK Library License</a>, which is the GNU
Library General Public License with an \e exception added that allows you
to distribute statically-linked programs using the library without
providing source code to the program or the library). You can thus use
FLTK in any software, whether or not you include the source code.

\section name What Does "FLTK" Mean?

FLTK was originally designed to be compatible with the Forms Library
written for SGI machines (a derivative of this library called "XForms"
is still used quite often). In that library all the functions and
structures started with &quot;fl_&quot;. This naming was extended to
all new methods and widgets in the C++ library, and this prefix "FL"
was taken as the name of the library.

After FL was released as open source, it was discovered it was
impossible to search &quot;FL&quot; on the Internet, due to the fact
that it is also the abbreviation for Florida. After much debating and
searching for a new name for the toolkit, which was already in use by
several people, Bill came up with &quot;FLTK&quot;, with the bogus
excuse that it stands for the &quot;Fast Light Tool Kit&quot;.

\section features Features

FLTK was designed to be statically linked. This was done by splitting 
it into many small objects and designing it so that functions that are 
not used do not have pointers to them in the parts that are used, and 
thus do not get linked in. It is also designed so that all data used by
the GUI, such as images and widget layout, can be inlined into source
code.

This allows you to make an easy-to-install program, or to modify FLTK
to the exact requirements of your application, without worrying about
bloat.

However, FLTK works fine as a shared library. It is often included in
this form on Linux distributions.

Here are some of the core features unique to FLTK:
- sizeof(fltk:\:Widget) == 60.
- The &quot;core&quot; (the &quot;hello&quot; program compiled &amp; linked with a static 
FLTK  library using gcc on a 486 and then stripped) is 82K.
- The FLUID program (which includes every widget) is 352k.
- Written directly atop Xlib (or WIN32) for maximum speed,  and 
carefully optimized for code size and performance.
- Precise low-level compatibility between the X11 and WIN32  version 
(only about 10% of the code is different).
- Interactive user interface builder program. Output is 
 human-readable and editable C++ source code.
- Support for X11 overlay hardware (emulation if none and under
WIN32.)
- Very small &amp; fast portable 2-D drawing library with PostScript
style functions, to hide  Xlib and WIN32.
- OpenGL/Mesa drawing area widget.
- Support for OpenGL overlay hardware on both X11 and WIN32. 
Emulation if none.
- Text input fields with Emacs key bindings, X cut &amp; paste, and 
foreign letter compose!
- Compatibility header file for the GLUT library.
- Compatibility header file for the XForms library.
- Much too much to list here...

\section history History of FLTK

It has always been Bill's belief that the "operating system" does not
have to provide <i>any</i> of what people call "GUI".  Toolkits (even
FLTK) are <I>not</I> what should be provided, the system only has to
provide arbitrary shaped but featureless windows, a <i>powerful</i>
set of graphics drawing calls, and a <i>simple, unalterable</i> method
of delivering events to the owners of the windows. Much of the design
of FLTK is to prove that complex UI ideas could be entirely
implemented in a user space toolkit, with no knowledge or support by
the system.

Many of the ideas in FLTK were developed on a NeXT (but <I>not</I>
using NextStep) in 1987 in a C toolkit Bill called
&quot;viewkit&quot;.  Here he came up with passing events downward in
the tree and having the handle routine return a value indicating they
used the event, which got rid of the need for "interests" that so
complicated Motif and NeWS.

After going to film school for a few years, Bill worked at Sun
Microsystems on the (doomed) NeWS project.  Here he found an even
better and cleaner windowing system, and he reimplemented
&quot;viewkit&quot; atop that.  NeWS did have an unnecessarily complex
method of delivering events which hurt it.

With the death of NeWS Bill realized that he would have to live
with X. The biggest problem with X is the &quot;window manager&quot;,
which means that the toolkit can no longer control the window borders
or drag the window around. Indeed far more code is spent trying to
talk to window managers than would be needed to draw the borders
themselves. (fortunately the problems with X are also replicated on
Windows, and thus solving them helped with the porting to Windows).

At Digital Domain Bill discovered another toolkit,
&quot;Forms&quot;.  Forms was similar to his work, but provided many
more widgets, since it was used in many real applications, rather then
as theoretical work. Several large pieces of software were written
using a version of Forms with the menus and file browser replaced with
code from viewkit.

The need to switch to OpenGL, a desire to use C++, and the
closed-source nature of XForms, all led to a requirement to rewrite
Forms.  This produced the first version of FLTK.  The conversion to
C++ required so many changes it made it impossible to recompile any
Forms objects.  Since it was incompatible anyway, Bill decided to
incorporate his older ideas as much as possible.

Bill received permission to release it for free on the Internet, 
with the GNU general public license.  Response from Internet users 
indicated that the Linux market dwarfed the SGI and high-speed GL 
market, so he rewrote it to use X for all drawing, greatly speeding it 
up on these machines.  That is the version you have now.

FLTK 2.0 is a rewrite to make the interfaces to each widget more
consistent, to use C++ more correctly, including the ability (but not
the requirement) to support functor style callbacks, exceptions, and a
namespace, and to support themeing of the GUI without having to set
the color of every widget.

\section www Internet Resources

FLTK is hosted on a web site, http://www.fltk.org operated by Michael
Sweet of the Easy Software Corporation (the developer of CUPS). An SVN
repository of the source code, downloads of the fltk package, mailing
list and newsserver, bug tracking, and programs using FLTK are all here.

FLTK also has a SourceForge page at http://fltk.sourceforge.net,
though currently all source code is actually on the fltk.org site.

(Other stuff was here but I believe it was inaccurate. Need info on how
to read the mailing lists using usenet, get svn access, post bugs,
etc. This information is currently available at http:/www.fltk.org)
