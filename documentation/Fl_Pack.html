<h3>Description</h3>

This grouping widget arranges and resizes all of it's children so they
are all packed close together and completely fill the widget. This is
similar to layout widgets used by TK and some other toolkits.

<p><center><img src="Fl_Pack.gif"></center>

<p>In the above image the widgets 1,4,7, and 8 have the
<tt>fltk::PACK_VERTICAL</tt> bit on in their <a
href="Fl_Widget.html#flags">flags()</a>. The widgets are
numbered with the order they were added to the pack.

<p>Each child widget is stretched (ie one of it's dimensions is
changed and the other left alone) to completely fill the remaining
space on one edge of the pack and placed against all the previous
widgets on that edge.

<p>Any widget with the <tt>fltk::PACK_VERTICAL</tt> bit (8) set in the <a
href="Fl_Widget.html#flags">flags()</a> are placed against the left or
right edge, otherwise against the top or bottom edge.  (If <a
href="Fl_Widget.html#type">type()</a> of the pack is set to
<tt>fltk::Pack::HORIZONTAL</tt> then it will "pack horzontally" which
means that all widgets are packed against the left or right edges,
whether or not they have <tt>fltk::PACK_VERTICAL</tt> turned on)

<p>All widgets before the <a
href="FlGroup.html#resizable">resizable()</a> widget are placed
against the top and left edge, all widgets after the <a
href="FlGroup.html#resizable">resizable()</a> widget are placed
against the bottom and right edge in backwards order.  If the <a
href="FlGroup.html#resizable">resizable()</a> is not set, all widgets
are placed against the top and left edge, and the pack itself resizes
to surround them. Such a pack must be imbedded in another pack or be
the only child of a window so that this resizing can be used to layout
the parent widget.

<p>If any child changes size the pack automatically re-layouts and
possibly changes it's own size to accomodate it. If you add, move,
remove, hide, or show a child widget, or change the
<tt>fltk::PACK_VERTICAL</tt> flag, you should call <a
href="Fl_Widget.html#relayout">relayout()</a> on the pack yourself.

<p>The default box is <tt>fltk::FLAT_BOX</tt>. If you set it to
something else the border of the box is drawn and the widgets are
packed against the inside of this border.

<a name=Pack><h4>fltk::Pack::Pack(int x, int y, int w, int h, const char *label = 0)</h4></a>

Creates a new empty fltk::Pack.

<a name=~Pack><h4>virtual fltk::Pack::~fltk::Pack()</h4></a>

Like all groups, the destructor <I>also deletes all the
children</I>. This allows a whole tree to be deleted at once, without
having to keep a pointer to all the children in the user code.

<a name=spacing><h4>int fltk::Pack::spacing() const
<br>void fltk::Pack::spacing(int)</h4></a>

Gets or sets the number of extra pixels of blank space that are added
between each child widget.
