<H3>Description</H3>
 The <TT>fltk::Tabs</TT> widget is the &quot;file card tabs&quot; interface that 
allows you to put lots and lots of buttons and switches in a panel, as 
popularized by many toolkits. 
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=tabs.gif></P>
<P>Clicking the tab makes a child <TT>visible()</TT> (by calling <TT>
show()</TT> on it) and all other children are invisible (by calling <TT>
hide()</TT> on them).  Usually the children are <A href=FlGroup.html#Group>
<TT>fltk::Group</TT></A> widgets containing several widgets 
themselves. </P>
<P>Each child makes a card, and it's <TT>label()</TT> is printed on the 
card tab (including the label font and style).  The color of that child 
is used to color the card as well.  Currently this only draws nicely if 
you set <A href=Fl_Widget.html#box><TT>box()</TT></A> to the 
default <TT>fltk::THIN_UP_BOX</TT> or to <TT>fltk::FLAT_BOX</TT>, which gets 
rid of the edges drawn on the sides and bottom. </P>
<P>The size of the tabs is controlled by the bounding box of the 
children (there should be some space between the children and the edge 
of the <TT>fltk::Tabs</TT>), and the tabs may be placed &quot;inverted&quot; on the 
bottom, this is determined by which gap is larger.  It is easiest to 
lay this out in fluid, using the fluid browser to select each child 
group and resize them until the tabs look the way you want them to. </P>

<H4><A name=Tab.Tab>fltk::Tab::Tab(int x, int y, int w, int h, 
const char *label = 0)</A></H4>
 Creates a new <TT>fltk::Tab</TT> widget using the given position, size, 
and label string. The default boxtype is <TT>fltk::THIN_UP_BOX</TT>. 
<P>Use <A href=FlGroup.html#add><TT>add(fltk::Widget *)</TT></A>
 to add each child (which is probably itself a <TT>fltk::Group</TT>).  The 
children should be sized to stay away from the top or bottom edge of 
the <TT>fltk::Tabs</TT>, which is where the tabs are drawn. </P>
<H4><A name=Tab.~Tab>virtual fltk::Tab::~fltk::Tab()</A></H4>
 The destructor <I>also deletes all the children</I>. This allows a 
whole tree to be deleted at once, without having to keep a pointer to 
all the children in the user code. A kludge has been done so the <TT>
fltk::Tab</TT> and all of it's children can be automatic (local) 
variables, but you must declare the <TT>fltk::Tab</TT><I>first</I>, so 
that it is destroyed last. 
<H4><A name=Tab.value>fltk::Widget* fltk::Tabs::value() const
<BR> int fltk::Tabs::value(fltk::Widget*)</A></H4>
 Gets or sets the currently visible widget/tab. </BODY></HTML>
