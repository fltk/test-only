<h2>class fltk::Named_Style</h2>
<hr>

<h4>fltk::Named_Style(const char* name, void (*revert)(fltk::Style*), fltk::Style** pointer);</h4>

This subclass of <a href="Fl_Style.html"><tt>fltk::Style</tt></a> creates
a style that can be returned by <a
href="Fl_Style.html#find">fltk::Style::find()</a>. It also provides a
"revert" method that is used to restore the initial state so that
themes can be switched.

<p><i>name</i> is the name you want themes to use to look up the
style. If you don't care if themes can modify your class you can just
use <tt>NULL</tt> for the name.

<p><i>revert</i> is a function that initializes the style to it's
default value. The style is cleared to zero (meaning inherit from the
default style) before revert is called. If revert is NULL then
all-zeros is the default.

<p><i>pointer</i> is a back-pointer to the pointer to the
style. This allows multiple themes to exist at once, if an application
wants it (for instance a theme-editor application would like
this). The application can change this pointer to point at different
style structures and then all widgets that are constructed after that
get the new style. If you don't plan to use your widget in such a
program you can make a static instance of your style (rather than
using new) and pass null as this pointer.

<p>Here is an example of a class that wants the box to default to
fltk::ROUND_BOX:

<ul><pre><code>static void revert(fltk::Style* s) {
  s->box = fltk::ROUND_BOX;
}
static fltk::Named_Style* style = new fltk::Named_Style("MyWidget", revert, &style);

MyWidget::MyWidget(int x, int y, int w, int h, const char *l)
  : fltk::Widget(x,y,w,h,l)
{
  style(::style);
}</code></pre></ul>
