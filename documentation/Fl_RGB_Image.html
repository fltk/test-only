<h2>class Fl_RGB_Image</h2>
<hr>

This subclass of <a href="Fl_Image.html"><tt>Fl_Image</tt></a>
encapsulates a full-color RGB image, and allows you to 
make an <TT>Fl_Widget</TT> use an image as a label, or to just draw the 
image directly. This is more efficient than using <a
href="draw.html#fl_draw_image">fl_draw_image()</a> if you want to draw
the same image more than once.

<h4>Fl_RGB_Image(const unsigned char *data, int W, int H, int D = 3, int LD = 0)</h4>

Construct using a pointer to RGB data. <TT>W</TT> and <TT>H</TT> are 
the size of the image in pixels. <TT>D</TT> is the delta between pixels 
(it may be more than 3 to skip alpha or other data, or negative to flip 
the image left/right). <TT>LD</TT> is the delta between lines (it may 
be more than <TT>D * W</TT> to crop images, or negative to flip the 
image vertically).  The data pointer is simply copied to the object, so 
it must point at persistent storage. 

<h4>~Fl_RGB_Image()</h4>

The destructor will destroy any X pixmap created.  It does not do 
anything to the data.

<h4>void draw(int x, int y, int w, int h, Fl_Flags = 0)</h4>

The image is drawn with the top-left corner at <i>x,y</i>. The
<i>w</i> and <i>h</i> are ignored. The <i>flags</i> are ignored
(although really it should use <tt>FL_INACTIVE</tt> to gray out the
image).

<h4>void draw(int x, int y, Fl_Flags = 0)</h4>

Draws the image with the upper-left corner at <tt>x,y</tt>.  This is 
the same as doing <tt>draw(x, y, this-&gt;w, this-&gt;h, flags)</tt>.
