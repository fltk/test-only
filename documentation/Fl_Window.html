<h3>Description</h3>

This widget produces an actual window.  This can either be a main
window, with a border and title and all the window management
controls, or a "subwindow" inside a window.  This is controlled by
whether or not the window has a <tt>parent()</tt>.

<p>Once you create a window, you usually add children
<tt>fltk::Widget</tt>'s to it by using <tt>window-&gt;add(child)</tt> for
each new widget.  See <a
href=Fl_Group.html><tt>fltk::Group</tt></A> for more information
on how to add and remove children.

<p>There are several subclasses of <tt>fltk::Window</tt> that provide
double-buffering, overlay, menu, and OpenGL support.

<p>The window's callback is done if the user tries to close a window
using the window manager and <a
href=Fl.html#modal><tt>fltk::modal()</tt></A> is zero or equal to
the window. <tt>fltk::Window</tt> has a default callback that calls
<tt>fltk::Window::hide()</tt> and calls <tt>exit(0)</tt> if this is the
last top-level window.

<h4><a name=Window>fltk::Window::Window(int w, int h, const char *title = 0)</a></h4>

The first form of the constructor should be used for a "top-level"
window (that is, one that is not inside another window).  It correctly
sets <tt>visible()</tt> to false and <tt>parent()</tt> to
<tt>NULL</tt>.  By not specifying the position of the window, the
window system will pick a place to show the window (some older X
window managers will allow the user to place the window by hand). If
you want to force a position you should call <tt>position(x,y)</tt> or
<tt>hotspot()</tt> before calling <tt>show()</tt>.

<p><tt>fltk::Widget::box()</tt> is set to <tt>fltk::FLAT_BOX</tt>.  If you
plan to completely fill the window with children widgets you should
change this to <tt>fltk::NO_BOX</tt>. If you turn the window border off 
you may want to change this to <tt>fltk::UP_BOX</tt>.

<h4>fltk::Window::Window(int x, int y, int w, int h, const char *title = 0)</h4>

<p>The second form of the constructor is for creating child windows.  It
leaves <tt>visible()</tt> set to true.

<h4><a name=~Window>virtual fltk::Window::~Window()</a></h4>

Calls destroy().  The destructor <i>also deletes all the
children</i>. This allows a whole tree to be deleted at once, without
having to keep a pointer to all the children in the user code. A
kludge has been done so the <tt>fltk::Window</tt> and all of it's
children can be automatic (local) variables, but you must declare the
<tt>fltk::Window</tt> <i>first</i> so that it is destroyed last.

<h4><a name=size_range>void fltk::Window::size_range(int minw, int minh, int maxw=0, int maxh=0, int dw=0, int dh=0, int aspect=0)</a></h4>

Set the allowable range the user can resize this window to.  This only 
works for top-level windows. 

<UL>

<li><tt>minw</tt> and <tt>minh</tt> are the smallest the window  can 
be. </li>

<li><tt>maxw</tt> and <tt>maxh</tt> are the largest the window  can be.
 If either is <I>equal</I> to the minimum then you  cannot resize in 
that direction.  If either is zero  then FLTK picks a maximum size in 
that direction such that the  window will fill the screen. </li>

<li><tt>dw</tt> and <tt>dh</tt> are size increments.  The  window will 
be constrained to widths of <tt>minw + N * dw</tt>,  where <tt>N</tt>
 is any non-negative integer.  If these are  less or equal to 1 they 
are ignored.  (this is ignored on WIN32)</li>

<li><tt>aspect</tt> is a flag that indicates that the window should 
preserve it's aspect ratio.  This is ignored by WIN32 and by most X
window managers (in addition X does not describe what to do if the
minimum and maximum sizes have different aspect ratios...)
</UL>

It is undefined what happens if the current size does not fit in the 
constraints passed to <tt>size_range()</tt>.

<p>If this function is not called, FLTK tries to figure out the range 
from the setting of <a href=Fl_Group.html#resizable><tt>resizeable()</tt></A>: 

<UL>

<li>If <tt>resizeable()</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt> (this is the  default) 
then the window cannot be resized. </li>

<li>If either dimension of <tt>resizeable()</tt> is less than  100, 
then that is considered the minimum size.  Otherwise the <tt>
resizeable()</tt> has a minimum size of 100. </li>

<li>If either dimension of <tt>resizeable()</tt> is zero, then  that is 
also the maximum size (so the window cannot resize in  that direction). </li>

</UL>

<h4><a name=show>void fltk::Window::show()</a></h4>

Put the window on the screen.  Usually this has the side effect of 
opening the display.

<p>It is harmless to call show() multiple times.  If the window is
already shown then it is deiconized and raised to the top.

<h4>int fltk::Window::show(int argc, char **argv, int i);</h4>

This must be called after <a
href=Fl.html#args>fltk::args(argc,argv)</a> to show the "main"
window, this indicates which window should be affected by any
<tt>-geometry</tt> switch.  In addition if fltk::args() has not been
called yet this does so, this is a useful shortcut for the main window
in a small program.

<h4><a name=child_of>void fltk::Window::child_of(const fltk::Window* parent);
<br>const fltk::Window* child_of() const;</a></h4>

Tell the system that this window will not have an icon, it will
dissappear and reappear when the parent window is iconized or shown,
and it is forced to always be above the parent window.  On X this is
called a "Transient window", and Windows calls this a "overlapping
child". This value is different than the <a
href=Fl_Widget.html#parent>fltk::Widget::parent()</a>, which must be
zero).

<p>On both X and win32 changing this value causes the window to be
removed from the screen.

<p>Win32 and some X window managers have an annoying bug where calling
show() on this window will also raise the parent window to right below
this, making many useful user interface designs impossible! On X some
old window managers may ignore the "TransisentForHint" and these
windows will come out the same as other windows.

<p>If you want a dialog that blocks interaction with the other windows
of your application or with all other applications, you need to look
at <a href=#exec>exec()</a> or possibly <a
href=Fl.html#modal><tt>fltk::modal()</tt></A>

<h4>int fltk::Window::show(const fltk::Window* parent);</h4>

Same as <tt>child_of(parent),show()</tt>.

<h4><a name=exec>bool fltk::Window::exec(const fltk::Window* parent = 0, bool grab = false);</a></h4>

Simple description: the window is popped up and this function waits
until the user closes it, this then returns a true if the user hit ok,
false if the user cancelled or closed the window in some other way.
During this time events to other windows in this application are
either thrown away or redirected to this window.

<p>This does <a href=#child_of><tt>child_of(parent)</tt></a> (using <a
href=Fl.html#first_window><tt>fltk::first_window()</tt></a> if
<i>parent</i> is null). It then does <a href=#show><tt>show()</tt></a>
to make the window visible and raise it. It then uses <a
href=Fl.html#modal><tt>fltk::modal(this,grab)</tt></a> to make all
events go to this window, and waits until <a
href=Fl.html#modal><tt>fltk::exit_modal()</tt></a> is called
(typically by the window being hidden or destroyed).

<p>The return value is <a
href=Fl_Widget.html#value><tt>value()</tt></a> of the window, which is
true only if some callback does <tt>window->set()</tt>. To use this, make an
OK button with a callback that does this.

<p>If <i>parent</i> is null the window that last received an event is used as
the parent.  This is convenient for popups that appear in response to
a mouse or key click.

<p>See <a href=Fl.html#modal><tt>fltk::modal()</tt></a> for what
<i>grab</i> does. This is useful for popup menus.

<h4><a name=show_inside>bool fltk::Window::show_inside(const fltk::Window* frame);</a></h4>

Make the window with a normal system border and behavior, but place it
inside the <i>frame</i> as though that was the desktop.  This is what
Windows calls "MDI". Typically the other window (which must already
be shown) is a child window so that space can remain around it for a
menu/tool bar.

<p>Notice that parent() of the window must be zero and it will remain
zero after this is called.  Fltk uses a zero parent to indicate that
the system is managing the window.

<p>On systems that don't support nested desktops (i.e. X) this does
<tt>show(frame)</tt>, which produces a normal overlapping window that
is tied to remain atop and iconize with the frame window (IMHO this is
a great improvement over MDI!).

<h4><a name=hide>virtual void fltk::Window::hide()</a></h4>

Remove the window from the screen.  If the window is already hidden or 
has not been shown then this does nothing and is harmless.

<h4><a name=destroy>virtual void fltk::Window::destroy();</a></h4>

Hides the window and also deletes all window system information about
the window, and thus returns if back to the state it was in before the
first show().  It is harmless to call this if the window is already
destroyed.

<p>Subclasses can override this, if you do this you must also override
the destructor and make it call destroy().

<h4><a name=shown>int fltk::Window::shown() const</a></h4>

Returns non-zero if <tt>show()</tt> has been called, but
<tt>destroy()</tt> has not been called.

<h4><a name=iconic>int fltk::Window::iconic() const</a></h4>

Returns true if the window is currently displayed as an icon.  Returns
false if the window is not shown() or hide() has been called.  <i>On X
this will return true for a short time after show() is called the
first time.</i>

<h4><a name=iconize>void fltk::Window::iconize()</a></h4>

 Iconifies the window.  If you call this when <tt>shown()</tt> is false 
it will <tt>show()</tt> it as an icon.  If the window is already 
iconified this does nothing. 

<p>Call <tt>show()</tt> to restore the window.

<p>Currently there are only <a href=x.html#icon>X</a> and <a
href=win32.html#icon>Win32</a> system-specific
ways to control what is drawn in the icon.  You should not rely on 
window managers displaying the icons.

<h4><a name=resize>void fltk::Window::resize(int,int,int,int)</a></h4>

Change the size and position of the window.  If <tt>shown()</tt> is 
true, these changes are communicated to the window server (which may 
refuse that size and cause a further resize).  If <tt>shown()</tt> is 
false, the size and position are used when <tt>show()</tt> is called. 
See <a href=Fl_Group.html#Group><tt>fltk::Group</tt></A> for the effect 
of resizing on the child widgets. 

<p>You can also call the <tt>fltk::Widget</tt> methods <tt>size(x,y)</tt>
and <tt>position(w,h)</tt>, which are inline wrappers for this virtual 
function.

<p>The special value <tt>fltk::USEDEFAULT</tt> may be used for x and y
indicate that the system should choose the window's position.

<h4><a name=hotspot>void fltk::Window::hotspot(int x, int y, int 
offscreen = 0)
<br> void fltk::Window::hotspot(const fltk::Widget*, bool offscreen = false)
<br> void fltk::Window::hotspot(const fltk::Widgetp, bool offscreen = false)</a></h4>

<tt>position()</tt> the window so that the mouse is pointing at the 
given position, or at the center of the given widget, which may be the 
window itself.  If <tt>offscreen</tt> is true then the window is
allowed to extend off the screen (some X window managers do not allow this).

<h4><a name=fullscreen>void fltk::Window::fullscreen()</a></h4>

Makes the window completely fill the screen, without any window
manager border or taskbar or anything else visible (at least that is
the intention, it is currenty not well implemented, only older X
window managers work. The Windows and Gnome and KDE taskbars remain
visible. Anybody who knows how to get this to work reliably is welcome
to contribute code to do so).

<p>You must use <tt>fullscreen_off()</tt> to undo this. This may not
work with all X window managers (and currently it is not successful at
hiding the Windows taskbar).

<h4><a name=fullscreen_off>int fltk::Window::fullscreen_off(int x, int y, int w, int h)</a></h4>

Turns off any side effects of <tt>fullscreen()</tt> and does <tt>
resize(x,y,w,h)</tt>. 

<h4><a name=clear_border>void fltk::Window::clear_border()</a></h4>

You may turn off the window manager border before calling show() on
the window the first time. On most window managers this means the user
cannot move, iconize, or resize the window (unless your program does it).

<h4><a name=border>bool fltk::Window::border() const</a></h4>

Returns false if clear_border() has been called.

<h4><a name=set_override>bool fltk::Window::set_override()</a></h4>

Windows with this property set will use the exact position and size
set by the programmer (will not be handled by the window manager) and
will not have an entry in the task list.  This will also clear the
window's border like clear_border() above. This is used by the fltk
menus and tooltips.

<p>On X this causes "override redirect".  This is only good for
short-lived windows as it can confuse X window managers, however this
is the only reliable and fast way to do it. This also turns on "save
under" which on many X servers (like XFree86) can make the window
disappear much faster by having the server rememeber what was behind it.

<h4><a name=override>bool fltk::Window::override() const</a></h4>

Returns true if set_override() has been called.

<h4><a name=label>void fltk::Window::label(const char*)
<br>const char* fltk::Window::label() const</a></h4>

Gets or sets the window title bar label.

<h4><a name=iconlabel>void fltk::Window::iconlabel(const char*)
<br>const char* fltk::Window::iconlabel() const</a></h4>

Gets or sets the icon label.

<h4><a name=make_current>void fltk::Window::make_current()</a></h4>

<tt>make_current()</tt> sets things up so that the drawing functions in <a
href=drawing.html><tt>&lt;fltk/draw.h&gt;</tt></A> will go into this
window. This is useful for incremental update of windows, such as in an
idle callback, which will make your program behave much better if it
draws a slow graphic.  <i>This call does not work for fltk::DoubleBufferWindow!</i>.

<h4><a name=current>static fltk::Window* fltk::Window::current()</a></h4>

Returns the last window that was made current.

<h4><a name=cursor>void fltk::Window::cursor(fltk::Cursor, fltk::Color = fltk::WHITE, fltk::Color = fltk::BLACK)</a></h4>

Change the cursor for this window.  This always calls the system, if
you are changing the cursor a lot you may want to keep track of how
you set it in a static varaible and call this only if the new cursor
is different. The colors only work on X, they are not implemented on
WIN32.</p>

<p>The following constants define the mouse cursors that are available:</p>

<UL>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_DEFAULT</TT> - the default cursor, usually an arrow (0)</LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_ARROW</TT> - an arrow pointer </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_CROSS</TT> - crosshair </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_WAIT</TT> - watch or hourglass </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_INSERT</TT> - I-beam </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_HAND</TT> - hand (uparrow on MSWindows) </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_HELP</TT> - question mark </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_MOVE</TT> - 4-pointed arrow </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_NS</TT> - up/down arrow </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_WE</TT> - left/right arrow </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_NWSE</TT> - diagonal arrow </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_NESW</TT> - diagonal arrow </LI>
<LI><TT>fltk::CURSOR_NONE</TT> - invisible </LI>
<li>Under X you can get any XC_cursor value by passing
<tt>fltk::Cursor((XC_foo/2)+1)</tt>).</li>
</ul>
