using namespace fltk;

/*! \file fltk/events.h

  FLTK Events are identified by the integer argument passed to the
  fltk::Widget::handle() virtual method. Often a widget will modify
  this number before passing it to it's children.

  Fltk only thinks about one event at a time. Therefore all of the
  other data about the event is stored in static memory, rather than a
  typical "event structure". It is accessed with fast inline functions
  of the form fltk::event_*.

  FLTK has very simple rules for sending events to widgets. The major
  unusual aspect of FLTK is that widgets indicate if they "handled" an
  event by returning non-zero from their fltk::Widget::handle()
  method. If they return zero, FLTK can then try the event
  elsewhere. This eliminates the need for "interests" (event masks or
  tables), and this is the main reason FLTK is much smaller than other
  toolkits.

  Most events are sent to the outermost fltk::Window containing the
  event, and those widgets are responsible for finding and sending the
  events to child widgets. Some events are sent directly to
  fltk::Widgets, this is controlled by the following methods, which
  the container widgets are required to call:
  - void fltk::belowmouse(fltk::Widget*)
  - void fltk::pushed(fltk::Widget*)
  - void fltk::focus(fltk::Widget*)
  - fltk::modal(fltk::Widget*, bool grab=false)

  If all the widgets that FLTK tries to send an event to return zero,
  then you can add global functions that FLTK will call with these
  events. This is done with fltk::add_event_handler()

  You can generate fake events by calling handle(int) on the correct
  widgets (usually a window). Currently you can change the values
  returned by the fltk::event_*() functions by storing the desired
  value into the static variables fltk::e_*, but this may change in
  future versions.

  \{
*/

/*! \var fltk::NO_EVENT

  Has the value zero. All fltk widgets return false if this is passed to
  their handle() method.

  Fltk will produce this for unrecognized X events, if it can figure
  out what window to send them to. You can then subclass Window and
  add a handler for these events. Unfortunately this is not done on
  Windows due to the \e enormous number of garbage messages a program
  gets, you should instead use Windows pre-filtering functions to look
  for unknown messages.
*/

/*! \var fltk::PUSH

  A mouse button has gone down with the mouse pointing at this
  widget. You can find out what button by calling
  fltk::event_button(). You find out the mouse position by calling
  fltk::event_x() and fltk::event_y(). These positions are relative to
  the corner of the widget whose handle() method is being called.

  A widget indicates that it "wants" the mouse click by returning
  non-zero from its handle() method. It will then become the
  fltk::pushed() widget (this is done by the enclosing group widget)
  and will get fltk::DRAG and the matching fltk::RELEASE events.
*/

/*! \var fltk::DRAG
  The mouse has moved with a button held down. The current button
  state is in fltk::event_state(). The mouse position, relative to
  this widget, is in fltk::event_x() and fltk::event_y().

  To receive fltk::DRAG events you must return non-zero when passed a
  fltk::PUSH event.
*/

/*! \var fltk::RELEASE

  A mouse button has been released. You can find out what button by
  calling fltk::event_button().

  To receive fltk::RELEASE events you must return non-zero when passed
  a fltk::PUSH event.
*/

/*! \var fltk::ENTER
  The mouse has been moved to point at this widget. This can be used
  for highlighting feedback. If a widget wants to highlight or
  otherwise track the mouse, it indicates this by returning non-zero
  from its handle() method. It then becomes the fltk::belowmouse()
  widget and will receive fltk::MOVE and fltk::LEAVE events.
*/

/*! \var fltk::MOVE
  The mouse has moved without any mouse buttons held down. This event
  is sent to the fltk::belowmouse() widget.
*/

/*! \var fltk::LEAVE
  The mouse has moved out of the widget. To get this event you must
  return 1 in response to a fltk::ENTER event.
*/

/*! \var fltk::MOUSEWHEEL
  The wheel was moved on the mouse. fltk::event_dy() contains how many
  clicks the wheel moved, positive for up and negative for down. There
  is also a fltk::event_dx() for any kind of horizontal scrolling
  device but nothing produces that yet.
*/

/*! \var fltk::FOCUS

  This indicates an \e attempt to give a widget the keyboard focus.

  If a widget wants the focus, it should change itself to display the
  fact that it has the focus, and return non-zero from its handle()
  method. It then becomes the fltk::focus() widget and gets fltk::KEY,
  fltk::KEYUP and fltk::UNFOCUS events.

  The focus will change either because the window manager changed
  which window gets the focus, or because the user tried to navigate
  using tab, arrows, or other keys. You can check fltk::event_key() to
  figure out why it moved, for navigation it will be the key pressed
  and for switching windows it will be zero.
*/

/*! \var fltk::UNFOCUS
  Sent to the previous fltk::focus() widget when another widget gets the focus.
*/

/*! \var fltk::FOCUS_CHANGE
  Sent to all parents of the new fltk::focus() widget when the focus
  changes. This can be used to record which child has focus so it
  can be restored later, or to scroll a view to show the focus.
*/

/*! \var fltk::KEY
  A key press event. Fltk sends these directly to the fltk::focus()
  widget. If it returns zero then fltk will change the event into
  fltk::SHORTCUT and try the widgets under the mouse.

  The key pressed can be found in fltk::event_key(). The text that the
  key should insert can be found with fltk::event_text() and its
  length is in fltk::event_length().

  If you are actually doing text editing, you should use
  fltk::compose() to process the individual keystrokes into I18N
  characters.
*/

/*! \var fltk::KEYUP
  Sent to the fltk::focus() widget. The key that was released can be
  found in fltk::event_key() (fltk::event_text() is not set).
*/

/*! \var fltk::SHORTCUT
  If the fltk::focus() widget is zero or it returns zero for an
  fltk::KEY event then FLTK tries sending this event to every widget
  it can, until one of them returns non-zero. fltk::SHORTCUT is first
  sent to the belowmouse() widget, then its parents and siblings, and
  eventually to every widget in the window, trying to find an object
  that returns non-zero. FLTK tries really hard to not to ignore any
  keystrokes!

  You can also make "global" shortcuts by using fltk::add_handler(). A
  global shortcut will work no matter what windows are displayed or
  which one has the focus.
*/

/*! \var fltk::DEACTIVATE
  The method Widget::deactivate() has been called on this widget or one of its
  parents. The function Widget::active_r() will now return false.
*/

/*! \var fltk::ACTIVATE
  The method Widget::activate() has been called on this widget or one of its
  parents. The function Widget::active_r() will now return true.
*/

/*! \var fltk::HIDE
  This widget is no longer visible, due to Widget::hide() being called on it
  or one of its parents, or due to a parent window being
  minimized. The function Widget::visible_r() will now return false.

  If you implement a widget class it is important to call your base
  class with this same event. Fltk relies on this to communicate the
  visibility of widgets that are windows to the system.
*/

/*! \var fltk::SHOW
  This widget is visible, due to Widget::show() being called on it or one of
  its parents, or due to a parent window being restored from minimized
  state. The function Widget::visible_r() will now return true.

  If you implement a widget class it is important to call your base
  class with this same event. Fltk relies on this to communicate the
  visibility of widgets that are windows to the system.
*/

/*! \var fltk::PASTE
  You should get this event some time after you call fltk::paste() or
  you return true for fltk::DND_RELEASE. The contents of
  fltk::event_text() is the text to insert and the number of
  characters is in fltk::event_length().
*/

/*! \var fltk::TIMEOUT
  This event is generated if you called Widget::add_timeout().
*/

/*! \var fltk::DND_ENTER
  The user is dragging something over your widget. Return 1 if you are
  interested in getting fltk::DND_DRAG and fltk::DND_RELEASE events.

  It is impossible to examine the text of the drag until you release
  it. There are system-specific variables that can be examined to
  determine the type of drag being done, but unless you are making a
  file-management application that wants to delete or rename the
  source files, you should not need this information.
*/

/*! \var fltk::DND_DRAG
  The user moved the mouse some more while dragging something. You
  might use this to move around a cursor indicating where the
  insertion will go.
*/

/*! \var fltk::DND_LEAVE
  The user moved out of the widget without releasing the dragged object.
*/

/*! \var fltk::DND_RELEASE
  The user let go of the mouse and dropped something on your
  widget. Return 1 if you are interested in getting this data. In this
  case you will get an fltk::PASTE event with the text of object. This
  is usually a URL string, such as a filename with "file:" on the
  start. All fltk widgets just insert the data as text into text
  editors.
*/

/*! \var fltk::TOOLTIP
  NYI. Sent when the mouse hovers over the widget long enough for it
  to pop up a tooltip. The base class handle() actually pops up the
  tooltip.
*/

/*! \fn int fltk::event()
   Returns the most recent event handled, such as fltk::PUSH or
   fltk::KEY. This is useful so callbacks can find out why they were
   called.
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_x()
  Returns the distance the mouse is to the right of the left edge
  of the widget. Widget::send() modifies this as needed before
  calling the Widget::handle() method.
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_y()
  Returns the distance the mouse is below the top edge
  of the widget. Widget::send() modifies this as needed before
  calling the Widget::handle() method.
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_dx()
  For fltk::MOUSEWHEEL events this is how many clicks the user moved
  in the x and y directions (currently dx is always zero).
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_dy()
  Reserved for future use if horizontal mouse wheels (or some kind of
  joystick on the mouse) becomes popular.
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_x_root()
  Return the absolute horizontal position of the mouse. Usually this
  is relative to the left edge of the screen, but multiple Monitor
  setup may change that.

  To find the absolute position of the current widget, subtract
  event_x_root()-event_x().
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_y_root()
  Return the absolute vertical position of the mouse. Zero is at the
  top.
*/

/*! \fn int  fltk::event_clicks()
  Returns the number of extra times the mouse was clicked.  For a
  normal fltk::PUSH this is zero, if the user "double-clicks" this is
  1, and it is N-1 for each subsequent click.
*/

/*! \fn void fltk::event_clicks(int i)
  Setting this value can be used to make callbacks think things were
  (or were not) double-clicked, and thus act differently.
*/

/*! \fn bool fltk::event_is_click()
  This is true for a short time after the mouse key is pressed.
  You test this on the RELEASE events to decide if the user
  "clicked" or "held" the mouse. It is very useful to do different
  actions depending on this.

  This turns off after a timeout (implemented on X only, currently),
  when the mouse is moved more than 5 pixels, and when the user
  presses other mouse or keyboard buttons while the mouse is down.

  On X this is used to decide if a click is a double-click, it is
  if this is still on during the next mouse press. On Windows and
  OS/X the system's indication is used for double-click.
*/

/*! \fn void fltk::event_is_click(bool)
  You can set this to zero with fltk::event_is_click(0), this can be
  used to prevent the next mouse click from being considered a double
  click. Only false works, attempts to set this true are ignored.
*/

/*! \fn unsigned fltk::event_key_repeated()
  True if the most recent KEY event was caused by a repeating
  held-down key on the keyboard. The value increments for each repeat.

  Note: older versions of fltk reused event_clicks() for this. This
  made it impossible to design a GUI where the user holds down
  keyboard keys while clicking the mouse, as well as being pretty
  hard to understand. So we had to change it for fltk 2.
*/

/*! \fn unsigned fltk::event_state()

  This is a bitfield of what shift states were on and what mouse
  buttons were held down during the most recent event. The flags
  to pass are described under fltk::SHIFT.

  Because Emacs screws up if any key returns the predefined META flag,
  lots of X servers have really botched up the key assignments trying
  to make Emacs work.  Fltk tries to work around this but you may find
  that Alt or Meta don't work, since I have seen at least 3 mutually
  incompatible arrangements. Non-XFree86 machines may also have
  selected different values so that NUMLOCK, META, and SCROLLLOCK are
  mixed up. In addition X reports the state \e before the last key
  was pressed so the state looks backwards for any shift keys, currently
  fltk only fixes this bug for the mouse buttons.
*/

/*! \fn bool fltk::event_state(unsigned mask)
  Same as event_state()&mask, returns true if any of the passed bits were
  turned on during the last event. So doing event_state(SHIFT) will
  return true if the shift keys are held down. This is provided to
  make the calling code easier to read.  The flags to pass are
  described under fltk::SHIFT.
*/

/*! \fn unsigned fltk::event_key()
  Returns which key on the keyboard was last pushed. Most non-keyboard
  events set this to values that do not correspond to any keys, so you
  can test this in callbacks without having to test first if the event
  really was a keystroke. The values returned are described under
  fltk::SpaceKey.
*/

/*! \fn unsigned fltk::event_button()
  Returns which mouse button was pressed or released by a PUSH or
  RELEASE event. Returns garbage for other events, so be careful (this
  actually is the same as event_key(), the buttons have been assigned
  the key values 1,2,3, etc.
*/

/*! \fn const char* fltk::event_text()
  Returns the ASCII text (in the future this may be UTF-8) produced by
  the last fltk::KEY or fltk::PASTE or possibly other event. A
  zero-length string is returned for any keyboard function keys that
  do not produce text. This pointer points at a static buffer and is
  only valid until the next event is processed.

  Under X this is the result of calling XLookupString().
*/

/*! \fn unsigned fltk::event_length()
  Returns the length of the text in fltk::event_text(). There will
  always be a nul at this position in the text. However there may be a
  nul before that if the keystroke translates to a nul character or
  you paste a nul character.
*/
