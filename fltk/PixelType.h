/**
  Enumeration describing how colors are stored in an array of bytes
  that is a pixel. This is used as an argument for fltk::drawimage(),
  fltk::readimage(), and fltk::Image.

  Notice that the order of the bytes in memory of ARGB32 or RGB32 is
  a,r,g,b on a little-endian machine and b,g,r,a on a big-endian
  machine. Due to the use of these types by Windows, this is often
  the fastest form of data, if you have a choice. To convert an
  fltk::Color to RGB32, shift it right by 8 (for ARGB32 shift the
  alpha left 24 and or it in).

  More types may be added in the future. The set is as minimal as
  possible while still covering the types I have actually encountered.
