/*! \class fltk::StyleSet

  Fltk can manage "sets" of styles. This is useful for making a
  program that displays more than one "theme" at a time, such as a
  program that edits or creates themes. The "test" widgets can display
  the theme under development, while the main widgets stay
  unchanged. Fluid uses this to allow you to try your program under
  different themes.

  Each widget "belongs" to a set, which is assigned to the current set
  when the widget is constructed.

  The actual implementation is to change the pointers such as
  fltk::Widget::default_style for every widget class to point to a new
  copy, so when the constructors for each widget are run they assign
  the new copy. The previous copies are saved and restored if the
  older set name is used.

  There are some problems. Many widgets are dynamically created (for
  instance pop-up menus) and may not inherit the expected theme unless
  you are careful. Also some global things such as the background
  color cannot be seperated into sets.
