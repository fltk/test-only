/*! \class fltk::xbmImage

  Image based on a 1-bit bitmap from memory. This matches the very
  first type of image provided with X10 in 1980 or so...

  Each byte in the bitmap determines 8 pixels, a 1 bit is opaque and
  a 0 bit is transparent. The low-order bit is the left-most (this
  is inverted from similar data used by Windows). If the width is
  not a multiple of 8 each line starts at the start of the next byte.

  // See the x11/Image.cxx for some code that is faster if the scale
  // is 1:1 or XRender is not being used. I ignore this as it is only
  // for X11 and it complicates the Image by adding xbmImage as a
  // friend.
