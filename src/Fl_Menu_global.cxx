  Make the shortcuts for this menu work no matter what window has the
  focus when you type it (as long as fltk::modal() is off). This is
  done by using fltk::add_handler(). This fltk::Menu widget does not
  have to be visible (ie the window it is in can be hidden, or it does
  not have to be put in a window at all).

  Currently there can be only one global() menu. Setting a new one will
  replace the old one. There is no way to remove the global() setting,
  and you cannot destroy the Menu!

  This should probably also put the items on the the Mac menubar.
