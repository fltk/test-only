/*! \class fltk::Window

This widget produces an actual window. This can either be a main
window, with a border and title and all the window management
controls, or a "subwindow" inside a window. This is controlled by
whether or not the window has a parent(). Internally there are now
significant differences between "main" windows and "subwindows" and
these really should be different classes, they are the same for
historic fltk reasons.

Once you create a window, you usually add children Widgets to it by
using add(child) or by using begin() and then constructing the
children. See fltk::Group for more information on how to add and
remove children.

There are several subclasses of fltk::Window that provide
double-buffering, overlay, menu, and OpenGL support.

The window's callback is done if the user tries to close a window
using the window manager and fltk::modal() is zero or equal to the
window. Window has a default callback that calls Window::hide() and
calls exit(0) if this is the last top-level window.

You can set the shortcut() and then that key will call the callback.
If you don't change it then that key will close the window.

/*! \fn void Window::size_range(int minw, int minh, int maxw, int maxh, int dw, int dh)

  Set the allowable range the user can resize this window to. This
  only works for top-level windows.
  - \a minw and \a minh are the smallest the window can be.
  - \a maxw and \a maxh are the largest the window can be. If either is
  equal to the minimum then you cannot resize in that direction. If
  either is zero then FLTK picks a maximum size in that direction such
  that the window will fill the screen.
  - \a dw and \a dh are size increments. The window will be constrained to
  widths of minw+N*dw, where N is any non-negative integer. If
  these are less or equal to 1 they are ignored. (this is ignored on
  WIN32)

  It is undefined what happens if the current size does not fit in the
  constraints passed to size_range().

  If this function is not called, FLTK tries to figure out the range
  from the setting of resizeable():
  - If resizeable() is NULL (this is the default) then the window
  cannot be resized.
  - If either dimension of resizeable() is less than 100, then that is
  considered the minimum size. Otherwise the resizeable() has a
  minimum size of 100.
  - If either dimension of resizeable() is zero, then that is also the
  maximum size (so the window cannot resize in that direction).

*/

/*! void Window::resize(int,int,int,int)

  Change the size and position of the window. If shown() is true,
  these changes are communicated to the window server (which may
  refuse that size and cause a further resize). If shown() is false,
  the size and position are used when show() is called. See
  fltk::Group for the effect of resizing on the child widgets.

  The special value fltk::USEDEFAULT may be used for x and y indicate
  that the system should choose the window's position. This will only
  work before show() is called.

/*! Cause the window to become visible. It is harmless to call this
    multiple times.

    For subwindows (with a parent()) this just causes the window
    to appear. Currently no guarantee about stacking order is made.

    For a outer window (one with no parent()) this causes the window
    to appear on the screen, be de-iconized, and be raised to the top.
    Depending on child_of() settings of this window and of windows
    pointing to it, and on system and window manager settings, this
    may cause other windows to also be deiconized and raised, or if this
    window is a child_of() then this window \e may remain iconized.

    <i>Window::show() is not a virtual override of Widget::show()</i>.
    You can call either one. The \e only difference is that if an outer
    window has had show() called already, Window::show() will raise
    and deiconize it, while Widget::show() will only un-hide() it,
    making it appear in the same stacking order as before but not
    changing the iconization state (on some X window managers it will
    deiconize anyway).

    The first time this is called is when the actual "system" window
    (ie the X window) is created. Before that an fltk window is simply
    an internal data structure and is not visible outside your
    program. To return to the non-system-window state call destroy()
    or ~Window(). hide() will "unmap" the system window.

    The first time show() is called on any window is when fltk will
    call fltk::open_display() and fltk::load_theme(), unless you have
    already called them. This allows these expensive operations to be
    deferred as long as possible, and allows fltk programs to be
    written that will run without an X server as long as they don't
    actually show a window.

  This is designed for a fast-changing graphic such as a selection
  rectangle. The implementation is to put the window into
  double_buffer() mode, and then set things so the on-screen image is
  being drawn before this method is called. The previous overlay image
  was erased before calling this by copying the back buffer to the
  front. Notice that the overlay will blink as you redraw it, you must
  trade off this annoyance against the slower update of the overlay
  if you just draw it normally in the draw() method.

  Some systems don't allow drawing in the front buffer. In this case
  the entire back buffer is redrawn and the overlay drawn atop it.

  The default version draws a red rectangle, so that mistaken calls
