/*! \class fltk::Valuator

  Base class for sliders and all other one-value "knobs".The
  fltk::Valuator class controls a single floating-point value and
  provides a consistent interface to set the value(), range(), and
  step(), and insures that callbacks are done the same for every
  object.

  Callbacks are done each time the user changes the value. So if they
  drag a slider, the callback is done each time the slider handle
  moves to a new pixel.

  For most subclasses you can call when() to get some other callback
  behaviors:
  - fltk::WHEN_CHANGED: this is the default, callback is done on
    any change.
  - fltk::WHEN_RELEASE: it will only do the callback when the user
    moves the slider and then lets it go on a different value than it
    started.
  - fltk::WHEN_RELEASE_ALWAYS: will do the callback when
  the user lets go of the slider whether or not the value changed.
  - fltk::WHEN_NEVER: do not do the callback, instead it will turn
    on the changed() flag.

  There are probably more of these classes in FLTK than any others:

  In the above diagram each box surrounds an actual subclass. These
  are further differentiated by setting the type() of the widget to
  the symbolic value labeling the widget. The ones labelled "0" are
  the default versions with a type(0). For consistency the symbol
  fltk::VERTICAL is defined as zero.

/*! \fn void Valuator::set_value(double)

*/

/*! \fn void Valuator::maximum(double)

  Sets the maximum value for the valuator. For most subclasses the
  user cannot move the value outside the minimum()..maximum() range if
  it starts inside this range.

  These values should be multiples of the step() to avoid ambiguity
  and possible implementation changes.

  For most subclasses, the minimum may be greater than the
  maximum. This has the effect of "reversing" the object so the larger
  values are in the opposite direction. This also switches which end
  of the filled sliders is filled.

  You probably need to redraw() the widget after changing the range.
*/

/*! \fn void Valuator::minimum(double)
  Sets the minimum value for the valuator. See minimum().
*/
 
/*! \fn void Valuator::range(double min, double max)
  Sets both the minimum() and maximum().
*/

/*! \fn void Valuator::step(double)

  Set the step value. As the user moves the mouse the value is
  rounded to a multiple of this. Values that are sufficently close
  to 1/N (where N is an integer) are detected and assummed to be
  exactly 1/N, so step(.00001) will work as wanted.

  If this is zero (the default) then all rounding is disabled. This
  results in the smoothest controller movement but this is not
  recommended if you want to present the resulting numbers to the user
  as text, because they will have useless extra digits of precision.

  For some widgets like Roller this is also the distance the
  value moves when the user drags the mouse 1 pixel. In these cases if
  step() is zero then it acts like it is .01.

  Negative values for step() produce undocumented results. 
*/

/*! \fn void Valuator::linesize(double)
  Set the value returned by linesize(), or restore the default
  behavior by setting this to zero. Values less than zero or
  between zero and the step() value produce undefined results.
*/

/*! Return the value set for linesize(), or the calculated value
  if linesize() is zero.

  The linesize is the amount the valuator moves in response to an
  arrow key, or the user clicking an up/down button, or a click of the
  mouse wheel. If this has not been set, this will return the maximum
  of step() and 1/50 of the range.

  in a subclass of those and change how the numbers are displayed.

  it does %d format. Otherwise it does a %.nf format where n is enough
  digits to show the step, maximum of 8.
