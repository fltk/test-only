/*! \fn bool fltk::event_key_state(unsigned key);

  Returns true if the given key was held down (or pressed) <i>during the
  last event</i>. This is constant until the next event is read from the
  server. The possible values for the key are listed under fltk::SpaceKey.

  On Win32 event_key_state(KeypadEnter) does not work.
*/

/*! \fn bool fltk::get_key_state(unsigned key);

  Returns true if the given key is held down \e now. This is different
  than event_key_state() as that returns how the key was during the
  last event. This can also be slower as it requires a round-trip
  query to the window server. The values to pass are described
  under fltk::SpaceKey.

  On Win32 fltk::get_key_state(fltk::KeypadEnter) does not work.
