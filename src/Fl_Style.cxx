/*! \class fltk::Style

  Each widget has a pointer to an instance of Style. Usually
  many widgets share pointers to the same one. Styles are linked
  into a hierarchy tree by the parent_ pointers.

  When you look up a value from a style (such as when box() is called)
  it looks at that style and each parent up until it finds a non-zero
  value to return, or until there are no more parents, in which case
  zero is returned. Thus changing a parent style can make global
  changes as long as widgets do not have local values set.

  When you "set" a style (such as by calling box(UP_BOX)) then the
  local member variable is set. Notice that by setting a zero value
  you will indicate that it should return the parent value.

  The method Widget::box(BOX) will create a dynamic() style for that
  widget, which is a child of the original style, and set the box in
  that style. This "unique" style is reused for any other changes to
  that widget and it is deleted when the widget is deleted. Thus
  changes to a single widget do not affect other widgets, but the
  majority of widgets all share a Style structure.

  Occasionally it is useful to see if a field has been set. To do this
  you can directly access the local member variables using names like box_.

*/

  Type of box to draw to indicate focus. This is always called with

  may require the basic boxes to draw this).
*/

/*! \fn GlyphStyle Style::glyph() const;

  Draw part of a widget, called a "glyph". Examples are the up and
  down arrows on sliders, the slider itself, and check boxes. The base
  class draws arrow buttons (because they are so commonly used), but
  most widgets that use this define their own function to call. A
  theme can make these functions point at it's own code and thus
  customize the appearance of widgets quite a bit.

  See \ref glyphs for the numbers.
  If you wish to write your own glyph function you should examine the
  ones in the fltk source code and in the sample theme plugins to see
  how the arguments are interpreted.
*/

/*! \fn Font* Style::labelfont() const;
  The font used to draw the label. Default is fltk::HELVETICA. 
*/

/*! \fn float Style::labelsize() const;
  Size of labelfont(). Default is 12. 
*/

/*! \fn Font* Style::textfont() const;
  Font to use to draw information inside the widget, such as the text
  in a text editor or menu or browser. Default is fltk::HELVETICA. 
*/

/*! \fn float Style::textsize() const;
  Size of text_font. Checkboxes and some other widgets use this to
  control the size of the glyph. Default is 12.
*/

/*! \fn float Style::leading() const;
  Extra spacing added between text lines or other things that are
  stacked vertically. The default is 2. The function fltk::drawtext() 
  will use the value from Widget::default_style, but text editors
  and browsers and menus and similar widgets will use the local value.
*/

/*! \fn LabelType* Style::labeltype() const;
  How to draw the label. This provides things like inset, shadow, and
  the symbols. fltk::NORMAL_LABEL.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::color() const;

  Color of the widgets. The default is fltk::WHITE. You may think most
  widgets are gray, but this is because Group and Window have their
  own Style with this set to fltk::GRAY75, and also because many parts
  of widgets are drawn with the buttoncolor().

  If you want to change the overall color of all the gray parts of the
  interface you want to call fltk::set_background(color) instead, as this
  will set the entry for fltk::GRAY75 and also set the "gray ramp" so
  that the edges of buttons are the same color.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::textcolor() const;
  Color to draw text inside the widget. Default is black. Check and
  radio buttons use this to control the color of the checkmark. It also
  controls the color glyphs() are drawn in.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::selection_color() const;
  Color drawn behind selected text in inputs, or selected browser or
  menu items, or lit light buttons. The default is fltk::WINDOWS_BLUE.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::selection_textcolor() const;
  The color to draw text atop the selection_color. The default of zero
  indicates that fltk will choose a contrasting color (either the same
  as the original color or white or black). I recommend you use the
  default if possible.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::highlight_color() const;

  The color to draw the widget when the mouse is over it (for
  scrollbars and sliders this is used to color the buttons). Depending
  on the widget this will either recolor the buttons that are normally
  colored with buttoncolor(), or will recolor the main area that is
  normally colored with color().

  The default value is zero, which indicates that highlighting is disabled.  */

/*! \fn Color Style::labelcolor() const;
  Color used to draw labels. Default is fltk::BLACK.  */

/*! \fn Color Style::highlight_textcolor() const;
  Color used to draw the labels or text when the background is drawn
  in the highlight_color. The default of zero indicates that fltk will
  choose a contrasting color (either the same as the original color or
  white or black). I recommend you use the default if possible.
*/

/*! \fn Color Style::buttoncolor() const;
  Color used when drawing buttons. Default is fltk::GRAY75.  */

/*! \fn unsigned char Style::scrollbar_align() const;
  Where to place scrollbars around a Browser or other scrolling widget.
  The default is fltk::ALIGN_RIGHT|fltk::ALIGN_BOTTOM.
*/

/*! \fn unsigned char Style::scrollbar_width() const;
  How wide the scrollbars are around a Browser or other scrolling widget.
  The default is 15.
*/

/*! \fn bool hide_shortcut() const;
  If false, draw &x in labels as an underscore. If true (the default)
  then the underscores are not drawn. In this case you should limit
  your &x shortcuts to menubar items, as shortcuts in buttons are not
  visible. The menubar will show them when Alt is held down.
*/

/*! \fn bool draw_boxes_inactive() const
