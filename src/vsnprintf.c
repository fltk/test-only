/*!
  printf a string and set of arguments into an output buffer. At
  most size-1 bytes will be written, and a NUL terminator is \e always
  added. The return value is the number of bytes that \e would be
  written if the buffer was big enough, if this is greater than \a
  size then you need to reallocate a buffer of retval+1 size to get
  the full result.

  FLTK provides an implementation of this function on the (few)
  systems that don't provide it. Include the <fltk/string.h> header to
  call this portably. FLTK's emulation is rather poor and has the
  following bugs:
  - Field width & Precision is ignored for %%%, %%c, and %%s.
  - A malicious user who manages to create a %%-fmt string that prints
    more than 99 characters can still overflow the temporary buffer.
    For instance %%110f will overflow.
  - Only handles formats that are both documented in the glibc man page
    for printf and also handled by your system's sprintf().
  - Return value is not correct. If the buffer overflows a value
    greater or equal to \a size is returned, but it is only a guess
    about the actual length.

  Windows, Linux, and BSD all have this function so FLTK's emulation
  is not used. Warning: some systems do not return the correct value
  when the buffer overflows. A common alternative is to return -1 or
  \a size.
