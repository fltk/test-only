/*! Restricts events to a certain widget.

 First thing: much of the time fltk::Window::exec() will do what you
 want, so try using that.

 This function sets the passed widget as the "modal widget". All user
 events are directed to it or a child of it, preventing the user from
 messing with other widgets. The modal widget does not have to be
 visible or even a child of an fltk::Window for this to work (but if
 it not visible, fltk::event_x() and fltk::event_y() are meaningless,
 use fltk::event_x_root() and fltk::event_y_root()).

 The calling code is responsible for saving the current value of
 modal() and grab() and restoring them by calling this after it is
 done. The code calling this should then loop calling fltk::wait()
 until fltk::exit_modal_flag() is set or you otherwise decide to get
 out of the modal state. It is the calling code's responsibility to
 monitor this flag and restore the modal widget to it's previous value
 when it turns on.

 \a grab indicates that the modal widget should get events from
 anywhere on the screen. This is done by messing with the window
 system. If fltk::exit_modal() is called in response to an fltk::PUSH
 event (rather than waiting for the drag or release event) fltk will
 "repost" the event so that it is handled after modal state is
 exited. This may also be done for keystrokes in the future. On both X
 and WIN32 grab will not work unless you have some visible window
 because the system interface needs a visible window id. On X be
 careful that your program does not enter an infinite loop while
 grab() is on, it will lock up your screen!

  Currently this is called for these reasons:
  - If there is a keystroke that no widgets are interested in, this is

    hotkeys.
  - Unrecognized X events cause this to be called with NO_EVENT. The

    own message handling function that does not call fltk.

  example is Emacs-style editing keystrokes in text editing widgets,
  which conflict with Microsoft-compatable menu key bindings, but we
  want the editing keys to work if there is no conflict.

  interested in it. A handle() method can call this in a KEY event. If
