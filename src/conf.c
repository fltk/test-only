        Typical config file format:

        ------- test.conf --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		key1 = value1							# this key is not in a section
		key2								# this key has no value associated
		
                [section1]
		# Three standard key/value pairs
            	    key1 = value1
            	    key2 = value2
            	    key3 = value3

                    [section1/subsection]					# this is how a subsection is defined
                	key1 = value1
                	key2 = value2

                [section2]
        	    key1 = value1
            	    key2 = value2

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Notes:
        - comments may be on a line by themselves or at the end of a line
	  - for comments at the end of the line, the comment separator
	    character must followed by whitespace
        - indentation/formatting is handled automatically (sorry!)
