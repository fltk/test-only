/*! \class fltk::Image

  A rectangular buffer of pixels that can be efficiently drawn on the
  screen. The draw() functions will copy (or "over" composite if there
  is alpha in the pixeltype()) onto the output, transformed by the
  current transform.

  NOTE: If you already have a set of pixels sitting in your own memory,
  drawimage() can draw it and is \e much easier to use. You should use
  this class \e only if you will be drawing the \e same image multiple
  times, with no changes to the pixels.

  The buffer is created and filled in by setting the type of pixels
  with setpixeltype(), the size with setsize(), and then calling
  buffer() (note that setpixels() calls buffer() for you). The initial
  buffer is filled with undefined contents.

  The best way to put data into the buffer is to make one or more
  calls to setpixels(), to replace rectangular regions.

  You can directly address the buffer() to read and write the
  pixels. The size of the buffer is in buffer_width() and
  buffer_height() (this may be much larger than width() and height())
  and the distance between lines is in buffer_linedelta(). If you
  change any pixels you should call buffer_changed() before the
  next draw().

  Due to operating system limitations, buffer() is usually not an
  array of pixeltype() pixels. Instead setpixels() converts pixels
  into a type the operating system can use. The type of pixels in the
  buffer is retured by buffer_pixeltype(). This is really
  inconvienent, so you can also call the method
  force_ARGB32_on(). This will cause buffer_pixeltype() to return
  ARGB32, so you can assume this at compile time. The implementation
  of Image may be less efficient (actually the overhead is zero on
  Windows and close to zero on most other systems)

  If buffer() has not been called, draw() will call the
  fetch() virtual method. It should call setpixeltype(), setsize() and
  setpixels(). This is used to defer reading image files or
  decompressing data until needed.  fetch() will also restore the
  buffer contents to the original values if you have written to the
  buffer. If fetch() does not allocate a buffer, draw() will draw a
  solid rectangle in the current color.

  Because Image is a subclass of Symbol, it may be used as a
  Widget::image() or as the box() in a Style. If you give it a name it
  can be drawn with "@name;" in a label. If resized, the Symbol
  _draw() method will use the inset() call to decide on edge
  thicknesses and will dice the image up into 9 individually-scaled
  pieces, which is very useful for GUI buttons and background images
  (this is similar to how Flash draws buttons).

  There are a number of subclasses such as jpgImage and pngImage that
  display compressed image data, either from in-memory data buffers or
  from files.

  Draw a image (a rectangle of pixels) stored in your program's
  memory. The current transformation (scale, rotate) is applied.

  - \a pointer points at the first byte of the top-left pixel.
  - \a type describes how to interpret the bytes of each pixel.
  - \a rectangle: the image is put in the top-left corner
  and the width and height declare how many pixels the image has.
  - \a line_delta is how much to add to \a pointer to go 1 pixel down.
  By setting \a line_delta to larger than \a depth(type)*r.w() you can
  crop a picture out of a larger buffer. You can also set it negative
  for images that are stored with bottom-to-top in memory,
  notice that in this case \a pointer still points at the top-left
  pixel, which is at the \e end of your buffer minus one line_delta.

  The X version of FLTK will abort() if the default visual is one
  it cannot use for images. To avoid this call fltk::visual(fltk::RGB)
  at the start of your program.

  Type of function passed to drawimage(). It must return a pointer
  to a horizontal row of \a w pixels, starting with the pixel at
  \a x and \a y (relative to the top-left corner of the image, not
  to the coordinate space drawimage() is called in). These pixels
  must be in the format described by \a type passed to drawimage()
  and must be the \a delta apart passed to drawimage().

  \a userdata is the same as the argument passed to drawimage().
  This can be used to point at a structure of information about
  the image.

  Due to cropping, less than the whole image may be requested. So the
  callback may get an \a x greater than zero, the first \a y passed to
  it may be greater than zero, and \a x+w may be less than the width
  of the image.  The passed \a buffer contains room for at least the
  number of pixels specified by the width passed to drawimage(). You
  can use this as temporary storage to construct a row of the image,
  and return a pointer offset by \a x into it.

/**
  Call the passed function to provide each scan line of the
  image. This lets you generate the image as it is being drawn, or do
  arbitrary decompression of stored data (provided it can be
  decompressed to individual scan lines easily).

  \a callback is called with the void* \a data argument (this can be
  used to point at a structure of information about the image), the x,
  y, and number of pixels desired from the image, measured from the
  upper-left corner of the image. It is also given a buffer of at
  least \a w pixels that can be used as temporary storage, for
  instance to decompress a line read from a file. You can then return
  a pointer to this buffer, or to somewhere inside it.

  The callback must return n pixels of the format described by \a
  type.

  The \a xywh rectangle describes the area to draw. The callback is
  called with y values between 0 and h-1. Due to cropping not
  all pixels may be asked for. You can assumme y will be asked for in
  increasing order.
