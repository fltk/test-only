/*! Startup method to set what X display to use. This uses setenv()
  to change the $DISPLAY environment variable, so it will affect
  programs that are exec'd by this one.

  This does some "uglification" required by X. If there is no colon
  in the string it appends ":0.0" to it. Thus a plain machine name
  may be used.

  On non-X systems this sets the environment variable anyway, even
  though it probably will not affect the display used. It
  appears that putenv is missing on some versions of Windows so I
  commented it all out there, sigh.
