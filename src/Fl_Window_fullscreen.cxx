/*! Make the window completely fill the \a monitor, without any window
  manager border or taskbar or anything else visible. Use
  fullscreen_off() to undo this.

  Known bugs:

  - Older versions of both Linux and Windows will refuse to hide the
  taskbar. Proposed solutions for this tend to have detrimental
  effects, such as making it impossible to switch tasks or to put
  another window atop this one. It appears that newer versions of both
  Linux and Windows work correctly, so we will not fix this.

  - Many older X window managers will refuse to position the window
  correctly and instead place them so the top-left of the border
  in the screen corner. You may be able to fix this by calling
  hide() first, then fullscreen(), then show(). We don't do this
  because it causes newer window systems to blink unnecessarily.

  - Some X window managers will raise the window when you change the size.

  - Calling resize() before calling fullscreen_off() will result in
  unpredictable effects, and should be avoided.

/*! bool Window::set_override()

  This may only be called on a newly constructed window before the
  first call to show(). There will be no border, similar to
  clear_border(). In addition, the window will get the exact position
  and size set by the program and will not have an entry in the task
  bar. This is used by the fltk menus and tooltips.

  On X this causes "override redirect". On most X systems this is
  only a good idea for short-lived windows such as menus and tooltips,
  and it forces the window to be atop all other windows. It also turns
  on "save under" on the assumption that the window is short-lived.
