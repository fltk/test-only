  may not be portable to some machines.
*/

  function is called with this and user_data() as arguments.
*/

/*! \fn void Widget::do_callback(Widget*, void*)
  You can also call the callback function with arbitrary arguments. */

/*! \fn void Widget::do_callback(Widget*, long)
  You can also call the callback function with arbitrary arguments. */

/*! \fn uchar Widget::type() const

  8-bit identifier that controls how widget works.
  This value had to be provided for Forms compatibility, but
  you can use it for any purpose you want (mostly for "bad object
  oriented programming" where you insert some subclass functionality
  into the base class). Widget subclasses may store values in the
  range 0-99 here (larger values are reserved for use by FLTK).

  The fltk::PackedGroup widget uses the low bit of the type() of
  each child to indicate HORIZONTAL (1) or VERTICAL (0).

  For portability FLTK does not use RTTI (Run Time Typing Infomation)
  internally (you are free to use it, though). If you don't have RTTI you can
  use the clumsy FLTK mechanisim, by having type() use a unique
  value.  These unique values must be greater than the symbol
  Widget::RESERVED_TYPE (which is 100).  Look through the header
  files for Widget::RESERVED_TYPE to find an unused number.  If you
  make a subclass of fltk::Window you must use Widget::WINDOW_TYPE+n
  (\e n must be in the range 1 to 7) so that is_window() will work, if you
  make a subclass of fltk::Group you must use Widget::GROUP_TYPE+n
  (\e n must be in the range 1 to 7) so that is_group() will work.  */

/*! \fn bool Widget::is_group() const
  Returns true for subclasses of fltk::Group. If so you can cast it to
  a group with <tt>(fltk::Group*)(widget)</tt>. This is done by using
  type(), but if your compiler supports RTTI you may want to safer
  <tt>dynamic_cast&lt;fltk::Group*&gt;(widget)</tt>.
*/

/*! \fn bool Widget::is_window() const
  Returns true for subclasses of fltk::Window. If so you can cast it
  to a window with <tt>(fltk::Window*)(widget)</tt>. This is done by
  using type(), but if your compiler supports RTTI you may want to safer
  <tt>dynamic_cast&lt;fltk::Window*&gt;(widget)</tt>. If this is true,
  is_group() is also true.
*/

/*! \fn Flags Widget::flags() const
  Each Widget, and most drawing functions, take a bitmask of
  flags that indicate the current state and exactly how to draw
  things. See \link Flags.h <fltk/Flags.h> \endlink for values.
  This is for copying the flag values, use flag(c) to test them.
*/

/*! \fn void Widget::flags(Flags f)
  Replace flags(). This is for constructors, don't use it elsewhere.
*/

/*! \fn void Widget::set_flag(unsigned f)
  Make flag(f) return true by turning on that bit. You can set
  more than one by or'ing them together.

  Make flag(f) return false by turning off that bit. You can turn
  off multiple bits by or'ing them toegher.
*/

  Make flag(f) return \a b. Same as b ? set_flag(f) : clear_flag(f).

  Flip the result of flag(f) if \a f is a single bit. If you or
  together bits it will flip them all.
*/

/*! \fn bool Widget::flag(unsigned f) const
  Returns true if the bit for \a f is on.
*/

/*! \fn bool Widget::any_of(unsigned f) const
  Returns true if \e any of the bits in \a f are on. Actually this
  is the same function as flag(f) but using this may make the code
  more readable.
*/

/*! \fn bool Widget::all_of(unsigned f) const
  Returns true if \e all of the bits in \a f are on. \a f
  should be several bits or'd together, otherwise this is the
  same as flag(f).
*/

/*! \fn void Widget::align(Flags);
  Forces the values of all the fltk::ALIGN_* flags to the passed
  value. This determines how the label is printed next to or inside
  the widget. The default value is fltk::ALIGN_CENTER, which centers
  the label. The value can be any of the ALIGN flags or'd together.
*/

/*! \fn void Widget::when(uchar)

  Flags indicating when to do the callback(). This field is in the
  base class so that you can scan a panel and do_callback() on all the
  ones that don't do their own callbacks in response to an "OK"
  button.

  The following constants can be used, their exact meaning depends on
  the widget's implementation:
  - fltk::WHEN_NEVER - Never call the callback (0).
  - fltk::WHEN_CHANGED - Do the callback each time the widget's value
  is changed by the user (many callbacks may be done as the user drags
  the mouse)
  - fltk::WHEN_RELEASE - Each keystroke that modifies the value, or
  when the mouse is released and the value has changed, causes the
  callback (some widgets do not implement this and act like
  fltk::WHEN_CHANGED)
  - fltk::WHEN_RELEASE_ALWAYS - Each recognized keystroke and the
  mouse being released will cause the callback, even if the value did
  not change. (some widgets do not implement this and act like
  fltk::WHEN_RELEASE)
  - fltk::WHEN_ENTER_KEY - Do the callback when the user presses the
  ENTER key and the value has chagned (used by fltk::Input and
  fltk::Browser.
  - fltk::WHEN_ENTER_KEY_ALWAYS - Do the callback when the user
  presses the ENTER key, even if the value has not changed.
  -fltk::WHEN_ENTER_KEY_CHANGED - Do the callback when the user
  presses the ENTER key and each time the value changes.

  indicate a size that the data will fit in. A parent widget is then
  expected to rearrange itself to accomodate the new size. This may

/*

New scheme to reduce the expense of calling redraw() on widgets.
The loss here is that if a widget is changed and also gets exposed, it
will be drawn twice. The gain is that region calculations are not done
on every redraw(), restoring the speed we had in earlier fltk.

I renamed damage(n) to redraw(n) to match fltk method style. damage(n)
is reserved for changing damage_ but for now use set_damage(n) for this.

Normal redraw(n) will turn on those damage bits in the widget and turn
on DAMAGE_CHILD in all the parents. Groups should call redraw_child()
on each child when DAMAGE_CHILD is on.

Expose events accumulates a region but does not turn on any damage
bits.  The flush() method on a window must cause this area to be
updated. This may be done by copying a back buffer. The normal window
calls draw() again with the clip region set and damage() set to
DAMAGE_EXPOSE. All widgets should redraw every pixel in the clip
region if DAMAGE_EXPOSE is turned on. Exposure that covers the
entire window is detected and changed into DAMAGE_ALL, so only one
redraw is done.

The redraw(x,y,w,h) function does the same thing as expose events but
it sets DAMAGE_EXPOSE. This is so flush() for double-buffered
windows can tell these apart from normal expose events.
